Here goes a description of the input required for your program.\hypertarget{a00015_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{Program input}\label{a00015_autotoc_md0}
The program options can be displayed by running {\ttfamily python ./src/main.py -\/h} ~\newline


This will return the possible input options and type of parameters.

For example, to calculate the side length of a square with the same area as a circle of radius r, you would run ~\newline
 {\ttfamily python ./src/main.py square -\/r 4} ~\newline


For the side length of a pentagon, you would provide ~\newline
 {\ttfamily python ./src/main.py square -\/r 4} ~\newline


The program will then return the side length of the selected object.
