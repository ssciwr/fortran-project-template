Here goes a description of the input required for your program.\hypertarget{a00029_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Program input}\label{a00029_autotoc_md5}
The input parameters are given in the file {\ttfamily data.\+inp}. Input blocks are currently surrounded by {\ttfamily \$start ... \$end}. There are three input parameters, {\ttfamily matdim} which sets the dimensionality of the square matrices and vectors and is a positive integer, {\ttfamily matval} which is used to fill the matrices/vectors and is a real number, and the logical {\ttfamily do\+\_\+diag} which specifies if the matrix diagonalization should be carried out.

The output is written to {\ttfamily data.\+out} and currently contains a real and a complex matrix after transformation when no diagonalization is performed; or the eigenvectors and eigenvalues if diagonalization is carried out.
