The program uses the L\+A\+P\+A\+CK routines D\+G\+E\+MV, and Z\+G\+E\+MV for real and complex matrix-\/vector multiplication; and D\+S\+Y\+EV and Z\+H\+E\+EV for the matrix diagonalization of symmetric/hermitian matrices. The links to the routine descriptions are provided in the subroutine descriptions.
